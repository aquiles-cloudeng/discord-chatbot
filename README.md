# discord-chatbot
This is a Discord bot I made just for fun, it has custom responses to certain messages and a custom welcoming message.

# Usage
Download Pyhton 3.6 (doesn't work with recet versions with an issue related to certificates)
Just edit the .env file and change the information there, you have to include the discord TOKEN and the server name.
Run in a console
```ruby
python bot.py
```
You should see a message saying "BarredorasChatBot se uni√≥ al mejor Discord de la vida!"
You can modify the string to customize the bot
